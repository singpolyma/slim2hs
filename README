html attribute parser (MUST QUOTE FOR NON CODE quoted and unquoted ' and ") -- spaces around equals
attributes can contain code -- need parens for spaces in code
output code on same line as tag (space before = also allowed)
tag text content on same line

wrapped attributes (configurable) -- line folding -- with wrap, omit assignment for bool attr
better shortcuts parser (compound shortcuts)

splat allows hashrocket-style attributes -- hmm? -- oh... actually allows arbitrary code which must be a hash -- hmm -- with tag key this allows creation of the tag dynamically as well

Inline HTML
Test escaping in text blocks
Interpolation / #{{ unescaped interpolation }}
Text block -- copy over extra spaces instead of folding them? spec says yes, but seems not relevant for html?  unless pre...
look into single quote -- appends a whitespace?
\ or , line folding for code blocks
=> and =< are code output with whitespace append/prepend... (also for ==)
/[...] conditional comment
End line with / to mark tag as self-closing
tag>, tag<, tag<> for leading/trailing whitespace?  test what it does
inline tags with `tag:`

think about embedded engines vs tags?
